Key steps include:

- Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle categorical and numerical features.
- Visualizing key insights about ride distances, passenger counts, and trip times.
- Evaluating models using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and RÂ².
- Deploying final predictions and comparing results across models.
